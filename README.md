## [b]Description[/b][br]
## Subscribes a listener to an event so it will be notified every time that event is published.  
## Use this to connect systems to a named event without hard node references.[br]
##[br]
## [b]Parameters[/b][br]
## • [code]event[/code]: The event/channel name to listen to (e.g. [code]&"player_damaged"[/code]).[br]
## • [code]method[/code]: The [code]Callable[/code] to invoke when the event is published.[br]
##[br]
## [b]Notes[/b][br]
## • Multiple listeners can subscribe to the same event; all will be called when the event fires.[br]
## • Events will be sent to listeners in order of subscription.[br]
## • If `_debug_enabled` is true, a SUB line is printed identifying the event and listener.[br]
